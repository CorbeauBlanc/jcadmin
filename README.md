A web-based interface to administrate Walter S. Heath's [jcblock](http://jcblock.sourceforge.net) junk call blocker program.

This is a Node.js server designed to run on the same machine as jcblock.
It provides a browser-based interface that machines on your home network can use to view caller ID and easily block annoying phone calls from telemarketers and scammers.
