# jcadmin
A web-based interface to administrate Walter S. Heath's [jcblock](http://jcblock.sourceforge.net) junk call blocker program.

Jcadmin is a Node.js server designed to run on the same machine as jcblock.
It provides a browser-based interface that machines on your home network can use to view caller ID and easily block annoying phone calls from telemarketers and scammers.

Jcadmin makes maintaining jcblock much easier, eliminating the need to manually edit files.  It also provides an easy way to see how often and when calls have been received from a given phone number.
